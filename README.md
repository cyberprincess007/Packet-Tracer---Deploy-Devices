# Packet-Tracer---Deploy-Devices
# Packet Tracer - Deploy Devices

## Objective
Deploy multiple devices in Cisco Packet Tracer using various methods.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version)

## Summary of Tasks
1. **Deploying Devices**
   - Located the **2911 router** in the Device-Specific Selection Box and dragged it to the workspace above `Router0`.
   - Selected the **1941 router** and clicked in the workspace above `Router1`.
   - Added a **4331 router** to the workspace above `Router2`.

2. **Deploying Multiple Devices of the Same Type**
   - Held down the `<CTRL>` key while selecting the **4321 router** to place it above `Router3`, `Router4`, and `Router5` without repeating the drag-and-drop process.

3. **Copying Devices**
   - **Method 1:** Selected `Router3` by dragging a box around it, then held `<CTRL>` and dragged it to create `Copy of Router3`. Repeated for `Router4` and `Router5`.
   - **Method 2:** Held `<SHIFT>` while selecting `Router1` and `Router2`, then held `<CTRL>` and dragged them to create `Copy of Router1`.

## Outcome
- Successfully deployed multiple network devices using drag-and-drop and click-to-place methods.
- Used shortcut keys (`<CTRL>` and `<SHIFT>`) to efficiently deploy and copy devices.
- Demonstrated proficiency with basic device placement and duplication in Cisco Packet Tracer.

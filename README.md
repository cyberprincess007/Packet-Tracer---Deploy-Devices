# Packet-Tracer---Deploy-Devices
# Packet Tracer - Deploy Devices

## Objective
Deploy multiple devices in Cisco Packet Tracer using various methods. In this Packet Tracer – Deploy Devices assignment, deploying devices simply means placing network devices (like routers, switches, etc.) into the Packet Tracer workspace so you can use them to build a network.

It’s basically the first step before configuring them — you’re taking them from the list of available devices in Packet Tracer and putting them on your virtual “desk” so you can connect and work with them.

In your specific assignment, deploying devices involved:

Finding a device in the Device-Specific Selection Box (e.g., 2911 router, 1941 router).

Adding it to the workspace (drag-and-drop or click-to-place).

Placing multiple copies of the same type of device more efficiently (using keyboard shortcuts).

Copying existing devices that were already placed.

It doesn’t mean configuring or turning them on — it’s just setting them in place in your network diagram so you can work with them later.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version)

## Summary of Tasks
1. **Deploying Devices**
   - Located the **2911 router** in the Device-Specific Selection Box and dragged it to the workspace above `Router0`.
   - Selected the **1941 router** and clicked in the workspace above `Router1`.
   - Added a **4331 router** to the workspace above `Router2`.

2. **Deploying Multiple Devices of the Same Type**
   - Held down the `<CTRL>` key while selecting the **4321 router** to place it above `Router3`, `Router4`, and `Router5` without repeating the drag-and-drop process.

3. **Copying Devices**
   - **Method 1:** Selected `Router3` by dragging a box around it, then held `<CTRL>` and dragged it to create `Copy of Router3`. Repeated for `Router4` and `Router5`.
   - **Method 2:** Held `<SHIFT>` while selecting `Router1` and `Router2`, then held `<CTRL>` and dragged them to create `Copy of Router1`.

## Outcome
- Successfully deployed multiple network devices using drag-and-drop and click-to-place methods.
- Used shortcut keys (`<CTRL>` and `<SHIFT>`) to efficiently deploy and copy devices.
- Demonstrated proficiency with basic device placement and duplication in Cisco Packet Tracer.
